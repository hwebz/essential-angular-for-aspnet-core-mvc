# Errata for *Essential Angular for ASP.NET Core MVC*

If you install .NET Core SDK 2.1.x, the `dotnet new` command in Listing 3-7 of the update for Angular 5 and ASP.NET Core 2 won't add a `bower.json` file to the project.

The `bower.json` file is used to add the Bootstrap package to the project so that HTML content can be easily styled. 

To create the file, open the project in Visual Studio, right-click on the SportsStore project item in the Solution Exporer, select `Add` > `New Item` from the popup menu and select the `Bower Configuration File` item template, which can be found in the `ASP.NET Core` > `Web` > `General` category. Click the `Add` button to create the `bower.json` file (and the hidden `.bowerrc` file that ensures packages are installed in the `wwwroot/lib` folder) and add the packages shown in Listing 3-16. Save the file and Visual Studio will use Bower to install Bootstrap and the packages it depends on.

Thanks to Roman Korecky for reporting this problem.

You may see the following error if you install the .NET Core 2.0 SDK and then try to create a project using the command in Listing 3-7:

    Error: Invalid parameter(s):
        --framework netcoreapp1.1
            'netcoreapp1.1' is not a valid value for --framework (Framework).
    Run dotnet new mvc --help for usage information.
    See https://aka.ms/dotnet-install-templates to learn how to install additional template packs.

This is a problem caused by the way that Microsoft manages the templates that are used to create projects. To work around this problem, create a file called `global.json` with the following content:

    {
    "sdk": {
        "version": "1.1.0"
        }
    }

Run the command in Listing 3-7 again and the project will be created using .NET Core version 1.1, which is the version used for the examples in the book.
